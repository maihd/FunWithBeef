Yolo Principles
===============
Making your game take time, if you thinks too much about principles, so you do nothing about game, you just think about your own principles. So the first and ultimate principles is "there no principles, make your game!".


Some advices I learn from id Software principles
------------------------------------------------
- Keep your absolutely simple. Keep looking at your functions and figure out how you can simplify further.
> You should learn Feynman technique, apply this to your code.

- No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don't depend on polish happening later. Always main constantly shippable code.
> This just for your personal works, but in another sense, if your prototype is not shippable, it prove nothing about business potential of the ideas.

- We are our best testing team and should never allow anyone else to experience bugs or see the game crash. Don't waste others' time. Test thoroughly before checking in your code.
> This is very true in my personal works, there is I'm only the member.

- Write your code for this game only - not for a future game. You're going to be writing new code later because you'll be smarter.
> Sometime I felt defuse to choose the name of code because I thought about future not-existed game, that my projects' delayed and drop later.

- Try code transparently. Tell your lead and peers exactly how you are going to solve your current task and get feedback and advice. Do not treat game programming like each coder is a block box. The project could go off the rails and cause delays.
> I have many experiences about this. When I stuck in a tasks, talk to my leaders or peers make the context clear. In my personal works, this is more true, when you talk to yourself or write down how to solve the current task is actually you are solving its. But its have it's own pros, you can have many ways to solve a problem, and you can too which is best.

- It's incridibly important that your game can always be run by your team. Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults upon load failure.
> In Unity, when render an mesh without material, its will render a purple texture on its, make me see where is the error. But in Cocos2dx, it's crash when you load a sprite failed. Compare two cases, I found this advices make sense.

- Great tools help make great games. Spend as much time on tools as possible.
> Compare Cocos2dx vs Unity again.

- As soon as you see a bug, you fix it. Do not continue on. If you don't fix your bugs your new code will be built on a buggy codebase and ensure an unstable foundation. 
> Sometimes I forget a bug of my professional works, later it take my gametime just for fix. My boss give me gifts, that's his anger.

- Encapsulate functionality to ensure design consistency. This minimizes mistakes and saves design time.
> Compare cjson vs rapidjson, which make you easier to use, make you confuse how to just parse an json text.

- Programming is a creative art form based in logic. Every programmer is different and will code differently. It's the output that matters.
> I wanna to give this to my lead, but it won't works. And in my personal works, I'm only programmer, but inspiring.


More advices
------------
- Proof your code are worked. Test your code when you writing its.
- Mindfulness about your code. Learn your code, understand your code, explain your code to yourself. Do Feynman technique if you need a starter kit.
