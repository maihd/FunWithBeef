Fun with Beef
-------------
Examples program create by Beef for learning purpose. Some examples can be using as solutions.
After deep dive in the details, solving problems with Beef, find out it is good for gamedev, special [yolo coding style](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/24).


Notes for beginners
-------------------
By [design](https://www.beeflang.org/docs/foreward/), Beef prefer performance-with-simple
code over complex-but-performance, which mean it's more C than C++, just as C# features for more ergonomic development. So, good C knowledges are better than C++, learning C is good ideas. [I have learn much C and topics](https://github.com/maihd/maicstyle), but  still feel not enough. Details can find in Orthodox C++ comparision topics.
