Fun with Beef
-------------
Beef learning space. Some examples can be using as solutions.
After deep dive in the details, solving problems with Beef, find out it is good for gamedev, special [yolo coding style](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/24).


Notes for beginners
-------------------
By [design](https://www.beeflang.org/docs/foreward/), Beef prefer performance-with-simple
code over complex-but-performance, which mean it's more C than C++, just as C# features for more ergonomic development. So, good C knowledges are better than C++, learning C is good ideas. [I have learn much C and topics](https://github.com/maihd/maicstyle), but still feel not enough. Details can find in essays sections. 


Essays

This folder contains essays to explain the ideas and research about Beef.

Examples
--------
This folder contains code examples. You will find code snippets from C# or C++ can be reused. Each example contains its own workspace, to avoid redundant building process for untargeted projects. And it's scaling better.
