# Advantage of BeefLang when do tweening
- C#-like reflection
- No reflection overhead
- Generate tween function for each fields of target type
- Tuple for per fields tweening
- Syntaxes sugar for manage allocations:
    - Lambda and delegate is memory allocation-aware
    - `new/delete` have support allocator
    - Code change is easy for Timer/Scheduler add custom allocator
- Safety typing:
    - Checking if target type is a reference type (class, pointer)
    - Make sure target type have all fields needed
- Limited:
    - No `Type.GetProperty()`
    - Property need to get through `get__{propertyName}`, `set__{propertyName}`
    - Check may cause compiling progress slow-down
    - All pointer typeof is resulting `void*`. Need use `if (type.IsPointer) type = type.UnderlyingType;`. 
    - All limited are only needed when checking fields.
